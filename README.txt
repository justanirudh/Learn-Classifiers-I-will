Packages required:
——————————————————————————————————————————
* readxl //to read from excel file
* caret //For knn and svm
* RWeka //For C4.5 and RIPPER classifier
* partykit //plot model
* kernlab //for svmLinear


File structure:
————————————————————————————————————————
Included file functions.R

It has 4 main parts:

1. #GENERIC FUNCTIONS: Used by multiple models (prepareDataset, divideDataset, genPredict, genPreProcess)

2. #MODEL-SPECIFIC FUNCTIONS: Functions specific to each model (c45Model, RIPPERModel, knnModel, svmModel)

3. #MODEL-RUN FUNCTIONS: One function per model that needs to be run to get the results (c45Run, RIPPERRun, knnRun, svmRun) 

4. #RUN CLASSIFICATIONS: Code to run each classification

How to run:
———————————————————————————————————
Jump to part-4 of the script (#RUN CLASSIFICATIONS)

1. Pass in the correct path of the provided .xlsx file to the path variable
Currently it is: path <- "~/R/project1/dataset.xlsx"

2. Below that you should see 4 ‘result lines’, one for each model that look like this:

#<ModelName> run
results <- <ModelName>Run(path)

Eg. for C4.5, it is
#C4.5 run
results <- c45Run(path) //result line

To get results for a particular model, uncomment the corresponding ‘result line’ and run the script. 
For starters, the C4.5 model is the uncommented model and the rest three are commented out. So, if you run the script right out of the box, C4.5 results should get printed. 
In order to run, say knn, comment out all ‘result lines’ except the one that corresponds to ‘knnRun’

3. After the result lines, you should see a bunch of lines that either print some value or store it in a variable. 
The legend for which variable stands for what is given below:

results -> result of any of the run methods(c45Run, RIPPERRun, knnRun, svmRun)best_conf -> The confusion matrix of the model among 5 instances of a model (created from different training and test sets) that gave highest accuracybest_model -> The model among the 5 instances of a model that gave highest accuracymax_acc -> Highest accuracy obtained out of 5 instances of a modelprecision -> Precision values array per class of a modelrecall -> Recall values array per class of a modelf1 -> F1 measure values array per class of a modelavg_accuracy -> mean of accuracies calculated of the 5 instances of the modelstd_accuracy ->   Standard deviation of accuracies calculated of the 5 instances of the model


4. You can run the script by the standard run command: Rscript script_name.R or run it from RStudio.
The results of each classification should be the *same* as reported in Report.pdf. In case you want to check if the plots in the Report are same as that generated by code, you can do plot(best_model) for any of the models except RIPPER. JRip pkg does not seem to return a model value that can be plotted
